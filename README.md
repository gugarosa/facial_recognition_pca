# Facial Recognition with PCA
This is the repository containing a simple, yet powerful, resolution of a facial recognition task.
It is achieved by using PCA, calculating eigenfaces and comparing their distance.

The code is well commented and written in .m files (MATLAB). Feel free to use or ask any questions. Note that it is also included the AT&T dataset, under their reference (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).
